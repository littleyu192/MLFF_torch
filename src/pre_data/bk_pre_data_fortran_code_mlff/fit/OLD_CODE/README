in the fread_dfeat, edit the fit.input
copy train.txt and dfeat.fbin in the file
 (1) Run First: feat_PCA_metric.f
 ../feat_PCA_metric.r
  It will read in the xxx_feat_train.csv
  Have to change image, maxNb,natom,ntype,nlpp2b,nlpp3b in the code (should
  be read in from a input file)
  It will do a PCA analysis, generate: PCA_eigen_feat (the singular values) 
  feat_PV: the transformation between features 
  feat_new_stored0: new feature (without normalization). 
  feat_new_stored:  new feature (after scaling and normalization). 
 
 (2) Run Second: sparcify_CUR2.f,
 ../sparcify_CUR2.r
  It will select reference states from the num_case 
  it will generate: Ind_reference
  weight_case

 (3) Run: GPR_fit_force.f
     It will use In_reference for the selected reference states
     Do a linear fitting. It will ask the parameter for the kernal. 
     However, it is worth to test different kernels
     The result is in E_fit. 

 (4) Run: linear_fit.f
     This start from new, just do a linear fitting, the result is in 
     E_fit.linear
