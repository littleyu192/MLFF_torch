---------------------------------------------------------
Rc_M: the maximum cutoff for all different features. This will provide a encompasing neighbore list, for all features
m_neigh: the maximum number of neighbore for all atom cases, within Rc_M, just used to open the memory 
Rm close to Rc, will provide a more uniform grid, smaller Rm, will have a more powerlaw grdi
iflag_grid: 1,2,3, three different ways to generate the grids. 
1: a straightforward exponential grid controlled by Rc, Rm, and Rc2, Rm. fact_base,dR1,dR2 are not used. 
2: a exponential grid constructed by Rc, Rm; Rc2, Rm. However, the metric is modified with the pair distribution 
   density (which is broadened by dR1(for c-b12 grid); dR2(for b1b2 grid), and a average density*fact_base addition
   so there will be no zero. 
3: The grid will be provided manually by file: grid3b_cb12_type3,itype, grid3b_b1b2_type3.itype (itype=1,ntype) files. 
   Within the file, n3b1 (for cb12), n3b2 (for b1b2) pairs of r1,r2 are provided, They are the end points of sin peak
1,2: they will be compatable with iflag_ftype=1,2, the two different ways for feature construction. 
3: will be compatable with iflag_ftype=3. 
iflag_ftype=1,2,3, three different ways to generate the feature. 
1: each sin peak will cover 2 grid interval
2: each sin peak will cover 3 grid interval
3: each sin peak is specified by (r1,r2) pair provided in  grid3b_cb12_type3.itype, and grid3b_b1b2_type3.itype
   So, iflag_grid=3 must be used. Only the Rc, Rc2 are used. The Rm, fact_base, dR1,dR2 will not be used in this case. 
E_tolerance: used to choose the image, remove the large error images
recalc_grid: whether to recalculate the grid. WHen iflag_grid=3, it always read in the grid.
